# Querying Data

## Overview
This sprint introduced foundational concepts in data management — from understanding how data is stored in memory to creating databases and writing SQL queries.

### Data Structures
**What I learned**:  
Primitive data types (int, float, char) are stored in volatile memory. Complex data structures help organize and persist data in non-volatile memory.

**Reflection**:  
This helped me understand why databases exist — to manage structured data beyond temporary storage.

### What is a Database?
**What I learned**:  
Databases are structured systems designed to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.

**Reflection**:  
I now see databases as the backbone of data analytics, enabling persistent, organized access to information.

### RDBMS
**What I learned**:  
Relational databases use tables, keys, and relationships to structure data.

**Reflection**:  
This clarified how SQL works under the hood—and why normalization is important.

## Next Steps
- Practice querying with SQL  
- Document insights from the MySQL setup and first queries  
- Apply concepts to the Maji Ndogo project
