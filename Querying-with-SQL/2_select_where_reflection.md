- Filtering rows using conditions
- Combining multiple filters

## Key Concepts
- `SELECT` for column targeting
- `WHERE` for row filtering
- Logical clarity in query writing

## Insights
Filtering by region and sanitation levels helped surface countries with infrastructure gaps. This is where SQL starts to feel like storytelling.
