# Lesson 4: LIKE Operator and Wildcards

## What I Practiced
- Pattern matching using `LIKE`
- Using `%` for flexible matches and `_` for exact character positions
- Filtering text-based data with partial keywords

## Key Concepts
- `LIKE 'K%'` matches values starting with K
- `LIKE '%stan'` matches values ending in 'stan'
- `LIKE '%an%'` finds values containing 'an'
- `LIKE '_____'` matches values with exact character length

## Insights
This lesson helped me see how SQL can be used for text exploration, not just numbers. Itâ€™s especially useful for cleaning messy data or searching through names and categories.
