# Querying with SQL – Learning Journey

This folder documents key lessons from the ALX Data Science Academy's SQL querying module. Each file includes either practice queries or reflections on real-world applications.

## Included Lessons

1. **Creating a database on access to basic services**  
   - SQL script to create and populate a structured dataset  
   - Reflection on schema design and handling NULLs

2. **SELECT and SELECT WHERE**  
   - Practice queries using filtering and conditions  
   - Reflection on querying logic and syntax clarity

3. **Logical and Comparison Operators**  
   - SQL examples using `AND`, `OR`, `=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`  
   - Reflection on building layered conditions

## Why This Matters

These lessons build the foundation for querying real-world datasets. I'm focusing on clarity, clean syntax, and documenting insights—not just code.

## Next Steps

I'll continue adding lessons selectively as I progress through the module, including aggregation, joins, and functions.
