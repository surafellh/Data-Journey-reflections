# Real-World Application: Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6)

## Scenario
Imagine working with a nonprofit organization focused on advancing Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. They've received a rich dataset from the United Nations and asked us to identify countries most affected by limited access to basic water services.

With limited resources, the organization wants to prioritize humanitarian efforts where the impact will be greatest.

## Problem
How can we use SQL to find countries with critically low access to drinking water and sanitation in 2020?

## Solution
Using logical and comparison operators, we filtered the dataset to highlight countries where either water or sanitation access was below 50%. These are the areas where targeted interventions could have the most impact. We found that South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo were the ones that were the most affected and needed attention.

## SQL Query
See `clean_water_sanitation_analysis.sql` for the full query.

## Reflection
This exercise showed how SQL can support real-world decision-making. It’s not just about querying data, but it’s about uncovering insights that guide action.
