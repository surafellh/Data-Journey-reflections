# 3.1 Lesson Overview: SQL Basics

This section introduces SQL as the language for interacting with relational databases. It covers the structure of SQL, its core components (DDL, DML), and best practices for writing clean, readable queries.

## Key Concepts
- SQL is declarative: we specify *what* we want, not *how* to get it.
- It’s divided into categories like DDL (structure) and DML (data manipulation).
- Syntax matters—clean queries are easier to debug and maintain.

## My Reflection
This section helped me shift from thinking like a programmer to thinking like a data analyst. I now see SQL as a way to *ask questions* of the data, not just manipulate it.
