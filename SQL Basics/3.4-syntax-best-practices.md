# 3.4 SQL Syntax and Best Practices

Writing clean SQL is more than just getting the query to run—it's about readability, maintainability, and collaboration.

## Best Practices
- Use uppercase for SQL keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`)
- Indent nested queries for clarity
- Comment your queries to explain logic
- Avoid `SELECT *`—be specific with columns

## My Reflection
This reminded me that SQL is a communication tool. Clean syntax helps others (and future me) understand the intent behind each query. I’ve started commenting my queries more intentionally.
