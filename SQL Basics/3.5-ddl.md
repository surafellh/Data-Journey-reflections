# 3.5 Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands define and modify the structure of database objects like tables and schemas.

## Common DDL Commands
- `CREATE`: Define a new table or database
- `ALTER`: Modify an existing table
- `DROP`: Delete a table or database

## My Reflection
DDL feels like architectureâ€”laying the foundation before any data flows in. It connects well with my background in design and planning. I now see table creation as schema design, not just setup.
