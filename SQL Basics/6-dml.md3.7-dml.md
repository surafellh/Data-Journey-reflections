# Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manage data within tables—adding, modifying, or removing records.

## Common DML Commands
- `INSERT`: Add new records
- `UPDATE`: Modify existing records
- `DELETE`: Remove records

## My Reflection
This section felt like working with live data. Unlike DDL, which sets the stage, DML is about interaction. I realized how important it is to write safe queries—especially when deleting or updating.
