# SQL Basics â€“ Section 3

This folder documents my learning journey through Section 3 of the ALX Data Science Academy: **SQL Basics**.

It covers foundational SQL concepts including:
- Data Definition Language (DDL): creating and altering tables
- Data Manipulation Language (DML): inserting, updating, and deleting records
- Syntax best practices and data types

Each `.sql` file contains practice queries with comments for clarity. The `.md` files summarize lessons and include personal reflections on what I learned, what challenged me, and how I improved.

This is part of my broader portfolio documenting real progressâ€”not just completion.  
See [Section 2](../section-2-folder-name) for database fundamentals.

ðŸ§  **Why it matters:**  
SQL is the backbone of data analysis. This section helped me build confidence in writing clean, purposeful queries and understanding how databases are structured and manipulated.
